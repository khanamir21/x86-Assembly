Implement multithreading under DOS
       The program is debugged under Turbo C 3.0. It adopts the simplest time slice 
rotation method to realize multi-threaded system. The program uses the most simple 
technology to realize multi-tasking system. It mainly uses setjmp in C standard library. 
And longjmp two functions, most of the programs are written in C / C + + language, but 
still inevitably used three inline assembly to switch the thread stack. Because of 
the system call under DOS, it is not reentrant. If the DOS system call is called in 
multiple threads at the same time, there will be problems such as crashes. 
Semaphores can generally be used to solve DOS reentry problems. The entire system 
uses a clock interrupt handler to complete the scheduling of tasks.
